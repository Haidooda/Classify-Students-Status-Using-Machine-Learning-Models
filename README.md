# Classify-Students-Status-Using-Machine-Learning-Models:
• Developed a machine learning model to classify student enrollment, graduation, or 
dropout status based on factors like grades, attendance, and marital status. 
• Applied all single and ensemble algorithms (e.g., KNN,Logistic Regression, 
SVC,Random Forest, Extra Trees,etc.....) with hyperparameter tuning, improving accuracy 
from 79.3% to 91.46%. 
• Implemented feature engineering, scaling techniques (Min Max, Standard, Robust), 
and feature selection using correlation thresholds. 
• Identified Extra Trees as the best model and with Min Max Scaling as the best feature scaling technique, achieving the highest 
accuracy of 91.46%.
